get rid of ray start offsetting altogether,
just check t > TINY instead.
 
grow BoundingBoxes by 1 ulp
BoundingBox4: intersects_fast: pass inverse ray dir as arg

wavefront_obj: fix normals: disconnect and flip shading if angle with geom > say 30 deg?

1) prove SIMD performance
   v BB4 = perfect
   * Face4
      - f32 first
	   - f64 for intersecting triangle only

2) cache efficiency
   * benchmarks for different sizes
   * compress BB
   * compress Faces

3) Better tree building
   * split left-to-right or right-to-left (sort asc. or desc.): measure resulting surface area.
   * Quad4
   * Tests that show BB, color faces
   * Surface area?
   * Measure and limit depth?

4) Early returns
   * Enter front branch first
   * Don't enter if BB fully behind intersection


Other:
  * BB4: do ray dir reciprical once, re-use 4 times

Mesh<Face>, Mesh<Quad> 
Offset ray for improved t precision
Hitrecord: store point
Mesh: Bounding box scaled to size 1, internal coordinates, compress vertices to 16 bit fixed point
Mesh tree: minimize depth: split to avoid 2*(N+1) children. E.g: 6 -> 2, 4 -> 2, 2, 2. Not: 6 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 2, 1, 2
Mesh tree: don't split in the middle of num_faces, split in the geometrical middle of the bounding box.
ui: respect spec view size
trait Object: intersects()->bool
Mesh::intersect: bounding boxes: cut ray short at hitrecord.t
